**I graduated from UNT!**

Honestly, it still sounds too good to be true. This feeling is likely because I have been in school for most of my life at this point. Graduating is bittersweet but I am happy to move on to another chapter in my life. I am also glad to beat senioritis (itâ€™s real, I swear) and learn at my own pace about things I am interested in through programming projects. I created this blog to share discoveries and information that I learned from doing projects. I also wanted to share my reviews on books that I read because I have more time on my hands and a growing collection of books I need to read.
