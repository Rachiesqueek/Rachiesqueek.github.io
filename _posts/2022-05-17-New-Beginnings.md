##New Beginnings 

**I graduated from UNT!**

Honestly, it sounded too good to be true. At this point, I have been learning at school for most of my life, so I was happy to graduate. I am also glad to beat senioritis (it's real I swear) and learn on my own pace about things I am intrested in through programing projects. I also wanted to share my reviews on books that I read because I have more time on my hands and a *growing* collection of books I need to read.
