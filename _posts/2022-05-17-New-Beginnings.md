**I graduated from UNT!**

Honestly, it still sounds too good to be true. This is probabaly because I have been in school for most of my life at this point. Graduating is bittersweet but I am happy to finally move to a new chapter in my life. I am also glad to beat senioritis (it's real I swear) and learn on my own pace about things I am intrested in through programing projects. I created this blog to share new discoveries and things that I learned. I also wanted to share my reviews on books that I read because I have more time on my hands and a *growing* collection of books I need to read.
