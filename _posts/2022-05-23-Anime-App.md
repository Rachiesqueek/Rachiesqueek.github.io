title: "Anime App using Jikan API"
---

I created an Anime app to test my React skills and work with REST API that I found in a Github page for free API. This API page has a list of free API that programmers can use for projects like mine. I think resourses like these are extremely useful so I was happy to see that there was an API for Anime. This inspired me to create an  Anime App. The API I chose for this project is the Jikan API because it is used for the MyAnimeList site which I have had prior use with tracking anime with.

You can find my Anime app on my Github below.
